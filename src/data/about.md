#Who am I?
Just a regular dude that likes all the things web dev, 99.99% self thaught, with a strong thirst of knowledge.
I really like tooling and GUIs which allow me to produce good quality systems and having fun for all the time.
I also fancy abstract and diverse asimmetry, favour straight line more than curves, design systems are my puzzles.

Which is why this portfolio, is more like a demo/playground when I try all the features of tomorrow css and js, in a very easy to use Gatsby wrapper.

Is there anything like Progressive Front-end developer? Who cares...
